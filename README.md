# lasso-logic

This repo is for the lasso logic. We will add any code the we should add for coding the lasso. This will be used as a storage space for the lasso. Will be commenting a lot in this repo. We have added a lot of code in this repo to add up for the upcoming competition.

So far there has been many errors, but we have many plans to fix the issue. Once we can get each piece of code fixed, we can combine these pieces of code for the competition.
